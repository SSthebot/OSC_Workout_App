# OSC Workout

If you like exercising but don’t want to pay the $3 a month that top-tier workout apps charge then this is the project for you. The plan is to design a free OPEN SOURCE mobile app that you can download from a browser (PWA) and run locally on your phone (NO backend for this project). The goal is to implement as many high-quality workout app features as we can. Ideally we will be able to grab data from your other workout apps, allowing you to import your workout history into the OSC app.


## Quick Start
Trying to just get the project running on your local machine? You are in the right spot!

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ufosc/OSC_Workout_App.git
cd OSC_Workout_App
npm install
npm start
```

Looking to set things up for making contributions, review the Prequisites section to ensure you have all necessary items installed, then continue down to the Start Guide for full details.

## Prerquisites
### NPM
NPM is a widely used package manager for JavaScript and will ensure that all needed packages are installed and ready to go prior to running the project. We will be using it to manage the front-end dependencies for this projects, to install: 
1. Visit the [installer page](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
2. Choose the installer version for your operating system.
### Git
Git is an open-source version control software supporting online repositories like GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, and others. To install:

1. Visit the Git [download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Choose the "standalone installer" for your operating system.

Hint: If you are on windows, we recommend you use the GitBash CLI that comes with the install. Otherwise, if you are on a Unix based system (Linux, MacOS), then use the normal terminal.

## Start Guide
Now all prerequisites have been installed, you are ready to run the OSC Workout Application!

### 1. Fork Repo
Go to the top of this page and select the gray `Fork` button at the top right of the repository page. This will create a copy of the current repository that is owned under your GitHub profile, you will be able to submit pull requests (PR) from this repository to the parent repository (OSC_Workout_App).

### 2. Clone To Local Machine
From the file location on your local machine where you want to store the project, run the following command:
```sh
   git clone <git url>
```
The git URL will be the URL found on your forked repository home page in Github by clicking the green `Code` button then HTTPS (should be default selected) at the top of your forked repository page.

### 3. Install Dependencies 
This will install all the needed NPM packages to be able to run the project.

Note: This only needs to be run the first time the project is launched and any time the repository package.json file is updated.

```sh
   cd OSC_Workout_App
   npm install
```
### 4. Launch the App
To launch, simply run the following command:
```sh
   npm start
```
### 5. Generate a Youtube Data API Key
The Youtube Data API is used to fetch short videos directly from Youtube. Without an API key, the app will cycle through the same few videos. To generate a key:

1. Ensure that you have an existing Google account. If not, then take the time to create one.
2. Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
3. Create a Project: Click on "Select a Project" at the top of the page -> "New Project"
4. Once a project has been created, go to the top left corner of the screen and open the drop down menu.
   Scroll down to "Products" -> "APIs and Services" -> "Enabled APIs & services"
5. At the top of the page, select "Enable APIs and Services" and search for "Youtube Data API v3"
6. Click on the API and select "Enable"
7. Once enabled, you will be redirected to the API/Service detail screen. At the top right corner, click on "Create credentials" and follow the steps to generate an API key.
8. Once the key has been generated, go to "Credentials" and locate the newly created key. Select it and click on "Show Key". The following product is your new API key.
   Optionally, you can apply restrictions as preferred in this section. It is recommended to restrict the API key to Youtube Data API v3.
### Important: Do not implement your API Key directly into the code!!! 
### Follow the instructions in the next section to secure your key.

## Securing your API Key
### API Keys are important credentials that should not be shared freely, especially when it comes to an open-source repository.
### Remember: NEVER PUSH YOUR API KEY TO THE REPOSITORY!

1. Run the following commands to create a new file named .env:
   ```sh
   cd OSC_Workout_App
   echo REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE > .env
   ```
   This is the file that will be referenced in the code, do not access the API key directly.
   Remember to replace YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE with your own API key from step 8 in the previous section.
3. The .gitignore should already be setup to ignore the .env file, but double check to be safe. Remember, never commit this to a repository.
4. Within the OSC_Workout_App directory, navigate to src -> Components -> Brainrot
5. Uncomment line 9 and either delete or comment out line 10.

Congratulations, you have now setup an API key.

## Past workout sessions

Log in with a username, then choose **Begin Workout**. Enter a session name (for
example, Leg day), its date, and each exercise's sets, weights, and reps. Select lb
or kg and optionally record your body weight. Use **Finish and save workout** to
save the session and open its date in **Past sessions**. Earlier dates can be used
to backfill workouts; future dates are rejected.

Open **Previous Workout** on Home or **Past sessions** in navigation to browse the
monthly calendar. Workout names appear on their dates; selecting a day displays
all sessions and their exercise/set details. Previous/next month and Today controls
let you navigate the calendar, including days without workouts.

The calendar works locally without a calendar API or API key. History is stored
in browser localStorage per normalized username, including the weight unit and a
snapshot of every set. It persists across reloads on the same browser but does not
sync between devices. Clearing browser data removes it. Usernames are local
profiles, not authenticated accounts. Storage errors are displayed without
clearing the workout form or overwriting unreadable history.

This is a custom calendar; it does not use a calendar API or external calendar
service. Username-based separation is not secure authentication: anyone using the
same browser can enter the same username or inspect its local storage. Do not
store sensitive information. Calendar month changes and day selections are kept
in the URL so refresh and browser Back/Forward restore the selected day and month.

The existing exercise library is available under **Workouts**. Its ExerciseDB
request requires a `REACT_APP_RAPIDAPI_KEY`; this is separate from the calendar,
which needs no API key.
